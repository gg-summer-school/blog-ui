        This is some text within a card body.
    To succeed, according to fomac [4] organizations must embrace a culture of change and be in a position to manage that change,
    hence the issue of change management.
    Managed change consists of some steps which if followed lead to efficient change management according to [5],
    one of which is the diagnose of the problem. Diagnosing the problem involves gathering data on where change is initiated and the viewpoints from which it could be perceived.
    These initiatives are usually from various change sources which implies that amongst them there are competing demands and hence conflicting constraints which if mishandled can
    lead to a failure in the organization. An organization can make use of direct conflict resolution techniques such as confronting or compromising just to list a few,
    but if they donâ€™t get to first identify the specifications associated with each requirement it may not be efficient especially if the compromising technique is used. The solution
    proposed in this report deals with combining the requirements from different sources of change and classifying them under a change matrix,
    identifying the interrelations amongst them, and also enumerating the constraints associated with each requirement so that we can appropriately resolve
    any conflicting constraint issue raised properly without affecting other components in the system.
    The usefulness of this project is illustrated upon application to the University of Buea's online platform.
